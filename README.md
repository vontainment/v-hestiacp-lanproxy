# v-HestiaCP-Nginx-Proxy-LAN
This is a collection of configs to use with HestiaCP for running inside your LAN behind Nat to access internal apps on one or more servers. Uses Hestia's lets encrypt to supply SSL.  Secure internal browsing of web GUIs or external access by IP, VPN or Mod Auth. Just getting this repo put together. Would love some communal help. Please join in sharing your LAN configs for HestiaCP. Help with readmes, commenting instructions, or other improvements.
